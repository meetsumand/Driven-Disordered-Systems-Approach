Codes used in "“A Driven Disordered Systems Approach to Biological Evolution
in Changing Environments”.


Description of files:

The codes are written in Fortran, compatible with Fortran 95. They can be compiled with the gfortran compiler. 

Codes til-2-greedy-dynamics-U-avg.f90 and til-2-greedy-dynamics-D-avg.f90 generate the the various averages along the U and D trajectories respectively reported in the paper for the TIL model. 

Codes Preisach-2-greedy-dynamics-D-avg.f90 and Preisach-2-greedy-dynamics-D-avg.f90  generate the the various averages along the U and D trajectories reported in the paper for the TIL model. 

Code til-2-greedy-dynamics-sec-mut-dist.f90 calculates the distribution of secondary mutations and the reversibility distance measure as reported in the paper.
